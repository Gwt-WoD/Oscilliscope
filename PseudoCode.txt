Trigger will be tired to one channel. 
When the voltage is within a small window of the trigger voltage it will be recorded as a triger point


main{
    get data from everything should end up with two channels and the User input scale and Trigger

    function get data snapshot(trigger,horizontal scale, Vertical scale){
        use the trigger to anchor the start of a wave
        take as many data points as samplerate*horizontal scale needs and store them in an array
        do some math on the array to find the min, max, and how many times the voltage was near the trigger point (frequency)
        to compress the data take 250 points of the data using floor(#datapoints/250) and send the rectified array to the DD
    }
    
}
