NOTES:

The SPI-compatible serial interface is controlled by the CS and SCLK signals. The input signal is sampled with the CS falling edge and SCLK is used for conversion and serial data output.

During conversions, both the AINP and AINM pins are disconnected from the sampling circuit. After the conversion completes, the sampling capacitors are reconnected across the AINP and AINM pins and the device enters acquisition phase.

The device also provides a simple serial interface to the host controller and operates over a wide range of digital power supplies. The device requires only a 16-MHz SCLK for supporting a throughput of 1 MSPS. The digital interface also complies with the JESD8-7A (normal range) standard.

The CS signal defines one conversion and serial transfer frame. A frame starts with a CS falling edge and ends with a CS rising edge. The SDO pin outputs the ADC conversion results.

A minimum delay of tSU_CSCK must elapse between the CS falling edge and the first SCLK falling edge

The device uses the clock provided on the SCLK pin for conversion and data transfer. The conversion result is available on the SDO pin with the first two bits set to 0, followed by 12 bits of the conversion result. The first zero is launched on the SDO pin on the CS falling edge. Subsequent bits (starting with another 0 followed by the conversion result) are launched on the SDO pin on subsequent SCLK falling edges. The SDO output remains low after 14 SCLKs. A CS rising edge ends the frame and brings the serial data bus to 3-state. For the acquisition of the next sample, a minimum time of tACQ must be provided after the conversion of the current sample is completed. For details on timing specifications, see the Timing Characteristics table.

The device has an internal offset calibration. The offset calibration can be initiated by the user either on power-up or during normal operation.

The device initiates offset calibration on first CS falling edge after power-up and the SDO output remains low during the first serial transfer frame after power-up.

## Offset Calibration

The device includes a feature to calibrate its internal offset. The device initiates offset calibration on the first CS
falling edge after power up and during offset calibration, the analog input pins (AINP and AINM) are disconnected
from the sampling stage. After the first serial transfer frame, the device starts operating with either uncalibrated
or calibrated offset, depending on the number of SCLKs provided in the first serial transfer frame. Offset
calibration can also be initiated by the user during normal operation. Figure 36 shows the offset calibration
process. The SDO output remains low during the first serial transfer frame.

The device includes an internal offset calibration register (OCR) that stores the offset calibration result. The OCR
is an internal register and cannot be accessed by the user through the serial interface. The OCR is reset to zero
on power-up. Therefore, TI recommends calibrating the offset on power-up to bring the offset within the specified
limits. If there is a significant change in operating temperature or analog supply voltage, the offset can be
recalibrated during normal operation.

### Offset Calibration on Power-Up

The device starts offset calibration on the first CS falling edge after power-up and calibration completes if the CS
pin remains low for at least 16 SCLKs after the first CS falling edge. The SDO output remains low during
calibration. The minimum acquisition time must be provided after calibration for acquiring the first sample. If the
device is not provided with at least 16 SCLKs during the first serial transfer frame after power-up, the OCR is not
updated. Table 2 provides the timing parameters for offset calibration on power-up.
For subsequent samples, the device adjusts the conversion results with the value stored in the OCR. The
conversion result adjusted with the value stored in OCR is provided by the device on the SDO output. Figure 37
shows the timing diagram for offset calibration on power-up.

tPOWERUP-CAL Calibration time at power-up 16 tSCLK ns
tACQ Acquisition time 200 ns
tPH_CS CS high time tACQ ns

### Offset Calibration During Normal Operation

The offset can also be calibrated during normal device operation. Offset calibration can be done during normal
device operation if at least 32 SCLKs are provided in one serial transfer frame. During the first 14 SCLKs, the
device converts the sample acquired on the CS falling edge and provides data on the SDO output. The device
initiates the offset calibration on the 17th SCLK falling edge and calibration is completed on the 32nd SCLK
falling edge. The SDO output remains low after the 14th SCLK falling edge and SDO goes to 3-state after CS
goes high. If the device is provided with less than 32 SCLKs during a serial transfer frame, the OCR is not
updated. Table 3 provides the timing parameters for offset calibration during normal operation.
For subsequent samples, the device adjusts the conversion results with the value stored in OCR. The conversion
result adjusted with the value stored in the OCR is provided by the device on the SDO output. Figure 38 shows
the timing diagram for offset calibration during normal operation.
